# DeepNewton

DeepNewton is a convolution-RNN which can effectively predict the future frames of a given simple video.
The collusions, momentum and speed is taken care by the conv-rnn inspired by [Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214v2.pdf).
